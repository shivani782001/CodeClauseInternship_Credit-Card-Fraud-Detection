# CodeClauseInternship_Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project, completed as part of my Data Science internship at CodeClause, focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Using a real-world dataset, I applied classification algorithms to accurately identify potentially fraudulent activities.

Technologies Used:

Python: Primary programming language
Pandas: Data handling and preprocessing
Scikit-Learn: Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizations

Project Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Scaling and normalizing features, handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE, and preparing data for model training.

Classification Algorithms: Implementing advanced models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Model Evaluation: Measuring performance with metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to ensure effective fraud detection while minimizing false positives.
